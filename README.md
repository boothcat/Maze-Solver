# Maze-Solver
Function puzzle_solver uses a breadth first search graph traversal algorithm to solve a 2D maze represented by a MxN (M rows, N columns) matrix. Each matrix index is either empty (represented by a '-') or a barrier (represented by a '#').  An example maze is shown below.


In python, this maze is represented as a list of lists.


* Function puzzle_solver - takes a starting coordinate (represented as a tuple), an ending coordinate (represented as a tuple), and a maze as parameters.
